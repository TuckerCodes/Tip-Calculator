Prework for the Codepath iOS (Swift) for Designers Class

<strong>Time:</strong> This prework took me aprox. 4 hours to complete. 
(1.5 hours watching instructional videos, 2 hours to construct and tinker with program, .5 hours to signup for Github and upload code.)

<strong>User Stories:</strong> Not sure if there were any user stories associated with this pre-work, but I can add some once I know the details.

<strong>Notes:</strong> Since this is my first time using Github, please let me know if I did anything incorrectly.
I was denied permission to view the instructional "GitHub for Mac" movie since my "handle is not associated with any course" - so I sought other sources online for help with the upload.
